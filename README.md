# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game, so basically just guess the secret number in minimum guesses, as every try counts !!!
This is a basic code including "Randit" from "Random", which lets the computer choose a secret integer.
In this I've used "While loop" concept.
a=-1, here its initially set to -1, which is out of the range of (1,100) so that the loop goes smoothly as it will never match the range. It's a placeholder.
Rest the code is easy to understand and its interesting, give it a try!!
